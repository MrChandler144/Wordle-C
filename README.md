# Wordle (C)
This is a side project I made during my university studies. It replicates the popular online phenomenon Wordle in a text-based form.
A word is selected from an external word list as the word the player must guess. Each guess is checked against the same word list, and if it is a valid word, the machinery of the program kicks in.
Grey tiles are represented by a 0, yellow tiles are represented by a 1, and green tiles are represented by a 2. The word you guessed is displayed alongside the letters, with individual letters capitalised if they are found in the word.
Finally, a keyboard is placed just under the display grid, representing letters guessed, unguessed and placed.
This was a lot of fun to make and required a lot of thought around handling edge cases.
